## About Titanic Project 🚢

- it deals with the legendary Titanic ML competition, where the main objective is to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck using a machine learning model.

> This project is my first project on Data Science based on a kaggle competition. It was done following the entire work of a Data Scientist (even if following someone else guidelines).
