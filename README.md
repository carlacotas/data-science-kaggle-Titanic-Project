## About Titanic Project

> This project is my first project based on a kaggle competition following the entire work of a Data Scientist (even if following someone else guidelines).

About the project: it deals with the legendary Titanic ML competition, where the main objective is to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. This prediction should be made using a machine learning model.
